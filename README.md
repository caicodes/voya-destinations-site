# Voya Destinations... 

Two sites currently for the voya project...

[voya app website](https://voya.web.app/) *coming soon...*

## voya destinations website

The voya destinations site (this repo) is showcased in it's current status here... [voya-destinations website](https://voya-destinations.web.app/)

This site is in Vue3 with Nuxt3 and uses tailwind css with daisyui, gsap, and @nuxt/pinia for theming, animations, and statemanagement...

The site is also on Firebase hosting with middleware via Nuxt3 for authorized routing, firebase auth, firebase firestore...

The future add-ons will include a nuxt3 + wp integration to allow for destinations to be managed with a wordpress backend and essentially a headless wp portion of this site that feeds those destination listings... further integration could include managing key pieces of content that can be updated within wp (use case, client updates via externally hosted (ie. not on firebase wp install) for easy and safe updates to destinations, and content... and potentially a lot more!)
