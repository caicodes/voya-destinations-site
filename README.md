# Voya Destinations... 

Started from a snazzy starter in parallel as it grows. Setting up a 'workspace' or examples master repo would be nice... yarn workspaces are perhaps a little tricky, but it could be ideal. I will figure it out as we build, same reason for forking this and moving forward on the Voya Destinations project.
