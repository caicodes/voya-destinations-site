# modules

a way to import/export code from project to project, done messy before, looking to streamline and improve...

1. check the package for contents, assets, etc...
2. assemble the setup notes/instructions in the readme...
3. zip/date when it's good... drag n drop it...
4. test and refine it, keep a modules port directory in other projects ongoing

## Pinia modules

First package ready, I'm staying on this to hop to the next project, bringing this amoungst other things to raise them all in tandem.

Pinia is ready, taking this to the next push on another project.

Ideas...

coinwire live
coins bank
mademoiselle
stripesafepay...

nuxt is starting to sink in... starting to feel really in command and the posibilities are expanding.
